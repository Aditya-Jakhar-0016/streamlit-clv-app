**Introduction:**
Client Lifetime Worth (CLV) expectation is fundamental for organizations to augment client maintenance and benefit. A CLV prediction model is created using machine learning methods in this project.
**Motivation**
The motivation behind this project is to provide businesses with a reliable tool to predict customer lifetime value, enabling better marketing strategies and customer relationship management.
**Innovations Utilized**
1. Python 3.7 or above
2. Microsoft VS Code IDE
3. Streamlit
4. Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, plotly, openpyxl
**Plan of the Project**
1. data/: Contains the dataset.
2. app/: Streamlit application for user interaction and CLV prediction.
3. requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
4. README.md: Project documentation.
**Arrangement and Establishment**
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Jakhar-0016/clv_app.git
   cd clv-prediction-model
2. Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the required libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
**Usage**
1. Run the Microsoft VS code IDE on the clv_app.py  to preprocess the data and develop the model.
2. Start the Streamlit application:
   streamlit run app/clv_app.py
3. Access the Streamlit app in your browser
